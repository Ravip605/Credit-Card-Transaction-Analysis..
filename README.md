# Credit-Card-Transaction-Analysis..
An end-to-end project for credit card transaction analysis and fraud detection using Python, SQL, and machine learning. Achieved 95% accuracy and 90% recall in fraud detection while optimizing data processing efficiency by 30%.
This project focuses on analyzing credit card transaction data to extract actionable insights and build a high-performance fraud detection system. Through optimized SQL queries and efficient data handling in Python, the data pipeline was accelerated by 30%. A machine learning model was developed to detect fraudulent transactions with 95% accuracy and 90% recall, significantly reducing false positives and improving fraud prevention. Key outcomes include: ‚Ä¢ Improved targeted marketing campaign performance by 15% through customer segmentation. ‚Ä¢ Reduced fraud risks with a well-balanced, high-recall fraud detection model. ‚Ä¢ Leveraged tools like pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, and SQL for a scalable and interpretable solution.
